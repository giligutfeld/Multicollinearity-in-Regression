# Data Science Final Project
The element in the data science pipeline that we are trying to improve is addressing multicollinearity in multiple regression analysis. The chosen element needs improvement because multicollinearity is a common issue in multiple regression analysis, it occurs when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated with each other. This can result in unstable and unreliable estimates of regression coefficients, making it difficult to interpret the effect of individual features on the response variable. Additionally, it can also cause problems in model selection and hypothesis testing.
